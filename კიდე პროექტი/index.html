        <h3>Asus was founded in Taipei in 1989 by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao, all four having previously <br>worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a <br>leading position in the computer hardware business. <br>Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, <br>and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately <br>six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. <br>According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, <br>but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. <br>When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself <br>had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. <br>Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' <br>motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. <br>Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.</h3>
