        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <!-- Html Paragraphs -->
        <h2>HTML Paragraphs</h2>

        <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>HTML Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>
            The HTML p element defines a paragraph.<br>
            A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
            <button>Try it yourself</button>

        <!-- Html display -->
        <h2>HTML Display</h2>
        <p>
            You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.<br>
            Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.<br>
            With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.<br>
            The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:<br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                This paragraph
                contains a lot of lines
                in the source code,
                but the browser 
                ignores it.
            </p>          
            <p>
                This paragraph
                contains      a lot of spaces
                in the source     code,
                but the    browser 
                ignores it.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.

        <!-- HTML Horizontal Rules -->
        <h2>HTML Horizontal Rules</h2>
        <p>The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.</p>
        <p>The hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Example</h3>
            <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
            <p>This is some text.</p>
            <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
            <p>This is some other text.</p>
            <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
            <p>This is some other text.</p>
            <button>Try it yourself</button>
            <p>The hr tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.</p>
        <hr>

        <!-- HTML Line Breaks -->
        <h2>HTML Line Breaks</h2>
        <p>
            The HTML br element defines a line break.
            Use br if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
            <button>Try it yourself</button>
            <p>The br tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.</p>
        <hr>

        <!-- The Poem Problem -->
        <h2>The Poem Problem</h2>
        <p>This poem will display on a single line:</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
            </p>
            <button>Try it yourself</button>
        <hr>

        <!-- Solution - The HTML <pre> Element -->
        <h2>Solution - The HTML pre Element</h2>
        <p>
            The HTML pre element defines preformatted text.<br>
            The text inside a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:<br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Example</h3>
            <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
            </pre>
