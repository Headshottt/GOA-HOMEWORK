        <h1>Santa Claus</h1>
        <p>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, <br>
            is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the late evening and overnight hours on Christmas Eve. 
            <br>
            He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his North Pole workshop, and with the aid of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.</p>

        <p>Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole with his wife, where he spends <br>the year making toys with the help of his elves. There he receives letters <br>from children asking for Christmas gifts.<br>On Christmas Eve he loads his sleigh with toys and flies <br>around the world, drawn by eight reindeer, <br>stopping at each child’s house; he slides down the chimney and <br>leaves the gifts, refreshing himself with the milk <br>and cookies left for him by the household’s children.</p>
